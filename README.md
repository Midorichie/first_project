# DeFi Protocol for Yield Farming and Staking with Bitcoin and Stacks

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to stake tokens and provide liquidity in exchange for rewards. It leverages the Stacks blockchain and incorporates Bitcoin (using wrapped assets like xBTC). Over three phases, the project will evolve, introducing advanced yield farming strategies and governance models.

## Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Initial Commit
In this phase, we implement a simple DeFi protocol using Clarity for yield farming and staking. Users can stake Stacks tokens (STX) or provide liquidity to earn rewards.

- Features:
  - Basic staking functionality for Stacks tokens (STX).
  - Liquidity pool functionality to allow users to deposit STX and earn rewards.
  - Smart contracts in Clarity for managing staking and liquidity pool transactions.

### Phase 2: Branch 1 - Bitcoin Staking Upgrade
In this phase, we introduce Bitcoin-based staking using wrapped Bitcoin (xBTC), allowing users to earn rewards for staking Bitcoin on the Stacks chain.

- Features:
  - Wrapped Bitcoin (xBTC) staking capabilities.
  - Integration of smart contracts to handle reward distribution based on pool performance.
  - Staking pools that support both STX and xBTC.

### Phase 3: Branch 2 - Advanced Strategies & Governance
In the final phase, we enhance the protocol with advanced staking strategies and introduce a governance model using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) system.

- Features:
  - Auto-compounding strategies for maximizing yield returns.
  - Yield optimization using the Bitcoin Lightning Network for quicker, low-fee interactions.
  - Governance model: Liquidity providers vote on protocol changes, fee structures, and other decisions via a DAO.
